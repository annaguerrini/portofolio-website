    <h1 class="about">ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr />
    <p class="intro">Hey there! I'm delighted that you ended up in this page â€” welcome! </p>
    </br>
    <h2 class="bio">WHO AM I?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Anna! 
    </br>
        I'm both portuguese and italian, born and raised in Lisbon in 1999, the year of "I Want It That Way" and "...Baby One More Time". I try everyday to refine my knowledge, as I love to discover new facts! Also, I'm extremely creative. Since I was a teenager I found interest in trying to find different ways to express myself, starting a Youtube channel in 2014, growing up to nearly 4000 subcribers.

    <h2 class="education">MY EDUCATION</h2>
    <p>
        I graduated from NOVA School of Science and Technology in Lisbon with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry. Right after, I decided to do volunteer trip to a conservation centre for marine turtles. This one month trip, working in sandals and VERY bad wi-fi, was my shocking awakening to the human impact on the environment and society. I believe I came back a completely different person.
        </br>
        At the end of 2021, I enrolled in SheCodes bootcamp. This enriching hands-on experience working with front-end and responsive development tools showed me what I was truly passionate about and, unbeknownst to me, I fell in love with technology! 
        </br>
        I'm always eager to learn more and more, accepting all challenges that life provides me.
    </p>
    </br>
    <h2 class="curiosities">CURIOSITIES</h2>
    <p>
        If you haven't guessed it yet, you'll now know: I'm a total geek!
        </br>
        I go to EVERY premiere of every Marvel Studios and Star Wars movie that comes out. In my free time, I love to read fiction/fantasy or watch educational documentaries. 
        </br>
        And as if that wasn't enough, I spend every minute I can listening to music. I currently have around 30 different playlists on Spotify that I created for every genre/mood/vibe (I promise I'm not crazy).
    </p>
    </br>
    <h2 class="why-work-with-me">WHY WORK WITH ME?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm adaptable and motivated to discover more, able to work under deadlines and in a team. I like to believe I can always do better than my previous work so, I keep pushing myself to dream bigger! I know how to work with clients and seek their needs, making both the client and the company happy. I'll never say to you that I can do everything you ask of me, but I'll definitely promise you that I'll do my research and gain new skills. After all, I love to learn!
    </br>
        The one thing I ask in return is a happy and healthy work environment, where employees have equal opportunity to grow both professionally and personally.
